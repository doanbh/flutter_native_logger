# Flutter Native Logger Error Fix

## Error Identified
1. Swift Compiler Error (Xcode): Type 'SwiftNativeLoggerPlugin' has no member 'prepareLogger'
2. CI/CD Error: Unknown receiver 'NativeLoggerPlugin'; did you mean 'SwiftNativeLoggerPlugin'?
3. ARC Semantic Issue (Xcode): No known class method for selector 'prepareLogger'

## Solution Implemented
1. Added the missing `prepareLogger()` method to the `SwiftNativeLoggerPlugin` class in `ios/Classes/SwiftNativeLoggerPlugin.swift`.

2. Updated the method channel and event channel names in the iOS plugin to match the Flutter implementation:
   - Changed from: `com.sharitek.soffice/native_logger` to `com.sharitek.native_logger/methods`
   - Changed from: `com.sharitek.soffice/log_events` to `com.sharitek.native_logger/events`

3. Created Objective-C bridge files to properly expose the Swift implementation:
   - Created `ios/Classes/NativeLoggerPlugin.h` - The Objective-C header file
   - Created `ios/Classes/NativeLoggerPlugin.m` - The Objective-C implementation file that forwards calls to Swift
   
4. Updated the podspec to include public header files and bridging support:
   - Added `s.public_header_files = 'Classes/**/*.h'` to `ios/native_logger.podspec`
   - Added `s.swift_objc_bridging_header = 'Classes/NativeLoggerPlugin-Bridging-Header.h'`
   - Added `s.preserve_paths = 'Classes/**/*.swift'`

5. Added proper Objective-C exposure for Swift methods:
   - Added `@objc(SwiftNativeLoggerPlugin)` to the Swift class declaration
   - Added `@objc` attribute to the `prepareLogger` and `register` methods
   - Created a bridging header file `NativeLoggerPlugin-Bridging-Header.h`
   - Updated Objective-C implementation to safely call Swift methods

## Implementation Details
1. The Swift `prepareLogger()` method was implemented to:
   - Initialize the logger for use outside of Flutter
   - Register for application lifecycle events

2. The Objective-C bridge was implemented to:
   - Forward the `registerWithRegistrar:` call to Swift code
   - Forward the `prepareLogger` call to Swift code safely with runtime checks
   
3. These changes ensure proper Swift and Objective-C interoperability, fixing all the reported errors.

## Test Instructions
1. Run `flutter pub get` to update dependencies
2. Try building your project that uses this plugin
3. If issues persist, check if there are channel name mismatches in any other files

## Next Steps
You may want to test this fix by using the plugin in an actual Flutter application.
