# Flutter Native Logger Error Fix

## Error Identified
Swift Compiler Error (Xcode): Type 'SwiftNativeLoggerPlugin' has no member 'prepareLogger'

## Solution Implemented
1. Added the missing `prepareLogger()` method to the `SwiftNativeLoggerPlugin` class in `ios/Classes/SwiftNativeLoggerPlugin.swift`.

2. Updated the method channel and event channel names in the iOS plugin to match the Flutter implementation:
   - Changed from: `com.sharitek.soffice/native_logger` to `com.sharitek.native_logger/methods`
   - Changed from: `com.sharitek.soffice/log_events` to `com.sharitek.native_logger/events`

## Implementation Details
The method `prepareLogger()` was implemented to:
1. Initialize the logger for use outside of Flutter
2. Register for application lifecycle events

## Test Instructions
1. Run `flutter pub get` to update dependencies
2. Try building your project that uses this plugin
3. If issues persist, check if there are channel name mismatches in any other files

## Next Steps
You may want to test this fix by using the plugin in an actual Flutter application.
